**XStructr - Josh Hummel**

The end goal of this project is to develop software that can model compounds and predict their properties through the use of machine learning
and concepts from chemistry, physics, and materials science.

**Roadmap:**<br />

[x] Complete physics engine of particles in Python <br />
[x] Complete physics calculation in C <br />
___ Implement better bonding with Molecular Orbital Theory <br />
[x] Add GUI for better customization of simulations <br />
___ Simulate in 3D <br />
___ Train ML model to recognize and predict properties of atoms <br />
___ Complete physics engine of materials and objects <br />
___ Train ML model to predict properties of compounds <br />

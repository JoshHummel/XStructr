To use this program, run main.py and choose Atomic Physics or Molecular Orbitals from the list on the left.

Atomic Physics:
    For a good visualization of atom interactions, a calculation time step of 10^-16 is recommended, as well as
    a simulation length of ~10^-11, a simulation time step of 10^-3 to 10^-6, and a length scale of 10^9. Currently not
    optimized for many particles, so test with <10.

Molecular Orbitals:
    Use an "n" value of 1-3, "l" value of 0/1, and "ml" value of -1, 0, or 1, following conventions of molecular orbitals.
    Use 10^12 for the scale for now.
